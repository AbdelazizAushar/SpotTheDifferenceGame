# Spot The Difference Game

## Overview

Spot The Difference Game is a C# Windows Forms application that challenges players to identify visual differences between two images. The game uses image processing techniques to detect differences and provides real-time feedback with sound effects. This project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming, timers, and basic computer vision with Emgu CV.

## Features

* Multiple difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) using different image sets.
* Automatic detection of differences between images using image processing.
* Timer-based rounds with event-driven feedback.
* Sound effects for correct or incorrect clicks.
* Merges overlapping differences to avoid duplicate detections.

## Technologies

* C# with .NET Framework (Windows Forms)
* Emgu CV for image processing
* WAV sound files for feedback
* JPEG images for difference detection
